## Project Brief

Build a simulated digital agency that offers one or more digital services (e.g., social media management, digital advertising, website design, content creation, or complete branding packages). Your agency should show a coherent brand identity, a simple business model, a sample client engagement, and deliverables produced during the simulation.

## Stages (Milestones)

### Stage 1 — Agency Setup (Week 2)
- Choose a team name and create a short brand identity.
